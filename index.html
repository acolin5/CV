            <h3>Airline Reservation System</h3>
            <p>
                This project is an airline reservation system implemented in Java, utilizing SQL to store and manage data in a database.
                The system allows users to perform various actions such as viewing available flights, canceling reservations, accessing their inbox,
                and contacting customer support. Additionally, an admin component is included, enabling administrators to verify login credentials,
                monitor gross sales, and generate flight log reports.
            </p>        
            <h2>Skills Gained:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Java Programming:</strong> The project is primarily developed using Java, including graphical user interfaces (GUI) created with Swing.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Database Management:</strong> SQL is used to interact with the database, including querying passenger data, canceling reservations, and fetching gross sales statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Connection:</strong> The project establishes database connections and manages them to retrieve and manipulate data effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Swing GUI Design:</strong> Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for both users and administrators are designed using Swing components, providing a user-friendly experience.</li>
                <li><strong>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):</strong> JDBC is utilized to connect to and interact with the MySQL database.</li>
                <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> The code includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and display appropriate error messages to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, database management, and user interface design,
                resulting in a functional and user-friendly airline reservation system with administrative capabilities.

            <h3>TimeOn - Scheduling Application</h3>
            <p>
                This project is a scheduling system implemented using React Native for mobile application development and React for the web, making it accessible on both mobile devices and web browsers.
                The application effectively addresses the challenges faced by businesses in managing employee schedules, monitoring working hours, and optimizing resource allocation across different locations.
            </p>     
            
            <h2>Skills Gained:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>React Native:</strong> React Native was utilized to build the mobile version of the scheduling application, enabling cross-platform compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>React for Web:</strong> React was employed to adapt the scheduling application for web browsers, ensuring a seamless user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Firebase integration provided real-time data storage, authentication, and database management.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Firebase Authentication was used to implement user authentication and access control.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Hosting:</strong> Firebase Hosting ensures reliable and scalable deployment for the web version of the application.</li>
                <li><strong>React Native Libraries:</strong> Various React Native libraries were used to enhance functionality and user experience, including React Navigation and React Native Modal.</li>
            </ul>
                       
            <p>
                In summary, the scheduling application is a versatile solution that leverages the power of React Native, React for the web, and Firebase to provide businesses with an efficient tool for managing employee schedules and locations.
                Its cross-platform accessibility, real-time updates, and user-friendly interface make it a valuable asset for organizations seeking to streamline their scheduling processes and resource allocation.
